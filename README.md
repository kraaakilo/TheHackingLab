# TripleA Hacking Lab

Welcome to my HackingLab repo ! This repository is intended to organize and manage my files related to Capture The Flag (CTF) challenges, penetration testing (pentest), and other security-related activities.

I have adopted IaaC architecture because i want to access my files from anywhere at any moment without the headache about starting configuring a lot of stuff. So let's dive in it.

## The structure of the repository

The repository is organized into the following main directories:

- **ctf/**: Contains subdirectories for storing CTF challenge files, write-ups, and tools used for CTF competitions.
  - **challenges/**: Subdirectories categorized by challenge types such as Web, Forensics, Crypto, Reverse Engineering, and Misc.
  - **writeups/**: Write-ups for completed CTF challenges.
  - **tools/**: Tools used for CTF challenges.
